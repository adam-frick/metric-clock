**Summary:**
A simple application that displays a "metric clock."

With metric time, a day is separated into 10 hours, with 100 minutes per hour, and 100 seconds per minute. This means that 100,000 metric seconds comprise a day (100 sec/min * 100 min/hr * 10 hr/day), instead of the traditional 86,400 seconds (60 sec/min * 60 min/hr * 24 hr/day). The metric second is shorter by exactly 136 milliseconds as a result.

SFML was used for timing and drawing the clock graphics. The Liberation Mono font is used to display the numbers and is included with the source files.

**Requirements:**
* C++11
* G++ compiler
* SFML 2.4+
